# Prelude

If you have not prepared the requirements for this bootcamp, I will suggest to check the videos that Andrew and his team put together for you.

You will need to register to the following services:
- Create a Github Account. You will copy Andrew's repository with the right formatting of the repo and must be public.
- Create a Gitpod account and install the extention for your browser.
- Create Github CodeSpace.
- Create the AWS account (This is the important one as you will spin all the service here). Make sure you have a credit/debit card ready.
- Create Lucidchart. This app allows you to create chart/diagram. Charts/Diagram are really useful to see the overview of what are you creating.
- Create Honeycomb.io account.
- Create Rollbar account.

Once you have registered with all of the services, you can go for the assignement for the week 0.


# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
This week I will be discussing about the billing for the services that I will spin for the duration of the bootcamp

Princing of aws services is vary depending of the region. And also make sure to use the region close to you.
Make sure you set the billing allarm so you dont have unexpected cost. Since my account is more than 1 year old, I can not use anymore the free tier but since I have plenty of AWS credit, I can use against all services (check alaways which accounts)

There are 2 ways to set the billing alarms.
