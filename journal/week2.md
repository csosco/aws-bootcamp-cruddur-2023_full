# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

This week the team will be talking about observability and some tools such as honeycomb, aws xray and cloud watch.


## Observability vs Monitoring

Logging is how you identify the problem in your system.

Problem of logging
- Time-consuming
- Tons of data with no context for why of the security events
- Needles in a haystack to find things
- Increase alert fatigue for SOC team and application team

Why Observability?
- Decreased alert fatigue
- Visibility of end2end of logs, metrics and tracing
- troubleshoot and resolve things quickly
- Understand application health
- Accelerate team collaboration
- Reduce overall operational cost
- Increase customer satisfaction

### ***Observability vs Monitoring***

Monitoring is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to watch and understand the state of their systems. Monitoring is based on gathering predefined sets of metrics or logs.

Observability is tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to actively debug their system. Observability is based on exploring properties and patterns not defined in advance.

***Instrumentation*** is what helps you to create or produce logs metrics traces.
