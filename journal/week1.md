# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## **Security on Container**

This week the team will be talking about docker containers and the best practice.
I will write the 10 best practices that you need to know.


### **What is container Security?**
Container Security is the practice of protecting your application hosted on compute service like  containers.

### **Why container is popular?**
It is a angnostic way to run application.
Most people started developing apps on container due to the simplicity to pass the package without considering requirements.


**Managed Vs Unmanaged Container**

Managed Containers means that the Provider (AWS) managed the underlying service for the container (ECS or EKS). In this case Cloud provider will be managing the security prospective .

Unmanaged Containers means you are running your container on your servers and you have to manage all the system (for example you will be in charged to apply security patches).

(Please refer to the Share responsability diagram on the journal Week0.md).




### **Docker Components**
![Docker Component](https://docs.docker.com/engine/images/architecture.svg)

- Client is basically is installed your docker locally (build, pull, run features)
- Server is the location where is running the container

Registry is a location of the images available on internet (an exampple is docker hub). you could have a private registry inside of your organisation.

#### **Security Best Practice**
- Keep Host & Docker Updated to latest security patches.
- Docker Deamon & containers should run in non root user mode
- Image Vulnerability Scanning
- Trust a Private vs Public Image Registry
- No Sensitive Data in Docker Files or Images
- Use Secret Management Services to share secrets.
- Read only file system and volume for dockers
- Separate databases for long term storage
- Use DevSecOps pratices while building application security
- Ensure all code is tested for vulnerabilities before production use





Use Snyk OpenSource Security to check vulnarabilities 

Aws Secret Manager

AWS Inspector/ Clair tool for image vulnerabilty scanning


## Docker

'''
docker images
'''

from docker, click the container image and go to  **attach shell** this open the shell on the contianer


I got problem commiting as I did some changes on github and the same time on gitpod. to solve 
'''
git pull --rebase
git push
'''
